Solutions for Advent of Code 2022
=================================

Last year in Python was ok:
my goal was to solve most challanges
and I just used the language I happened to be working with more at the time.
<br>
_Correction:_ Turns out I wrote some solutions in Ruby and Haskell last year!

This year, though, I don't have any clear goals in mind.
I probably should focus on a systems programing language like C++, Go or Rust.
Probably C++.
But C++ looks like an horrible language when compared to Go and Rust,
which are easier to learn and more fun to use.

Oh, and I promised that I would learn APL more than an year ago.

I'll just do the easier days in Ruby while I don't make up my mind.
Ruby solutions for simple tasks can look smaller and cleaner than Python and
it's the scripting language I enjoy the most,
although I sometimes find myself yearning for a few functional programming features in it
_(function composition! pipe operator!)_.
But to compensate for that, the objects are a joy to use!
